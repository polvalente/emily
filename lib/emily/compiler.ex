defmodule Emily.Compiler do
  @moduledoc """
  `Nx.Defn.Compiler` implementation that runs `defn` computations on
  `Emily.Backend`.

  The compiler walks `Nx.Defn.Expr` in Elixir and dispatches each node
  through the active backend — exactly what `Nx.Defn.Evaluator` already
  does — with two adjustments specific to Emily:

    * `__to_backend__/1` returns `{Emily.Backend, [device: …]}` so
      `Nx.Defn.to_backend/1` (and the callers that consult it, including
      `Nx.Serving`) allocate inputs and outputs on Emily rather than the
      process-default backend.
    * `__partitions_options__/1` always returns a single partition.
      MLX's Metal runtime was historically unsafe for concurrent kernel
      dispatch from multiple OS threads. `:max_concurrency` is accepted
      for API compatibility with `Nx.Serving` but capped at 1. For
      concurrent inference on a shared model use `Emily.Stream`.

  ## Public API

  Users do not call this module directly. Install it as the default
  compiler and `Nx.Serving` / Bumblebee picks it up:

      Nx.Defn.global_default_options(compiler: Emily.Compiler)

  Or attach it per-call:

      Nx.Defn.jit(&my_fn/1, compiler: Emily.Compiler).(input)

  The four callbacks on `Nx.Defn.Compiler` (`__jit__/5`,
  `__compile__/4`, `__partitions_options__/1`, `__to_backend__/1`)
  are invoked by `Nx.Defn` on your behalf.

  ## Design notes

  `__jit__/5` and `__compile__/4` delegate to `Nx.Defn.Evaluator`
  after filtering the option list down to the keys this module
  consumes. There is no external JIT cache beyond the
  closure `Nx.Defn.compile/3` already returns: Bumblebee and
  `Nx.Serving` hold that closure on warmup, so subsequent calls skip
  the walk.

  The compiler does not wrap `mlx::core::compile` by default. The
  single-NIF replay is the load-bearing win (it collapses the per-op
  BEAM↔worker round-trips); `mx::compile` is exposed as an *opt-in*
  compiled eval mode on the program resource, which fuses the
  elementwise runs the replay leaves separate. On a decode-shaped
  transformer block `bench/program_compile.exs` measures ~1.6× over the
  sync replay (kernel-launch + intermediate-memory overhead dominates at
  small sequence lengths, and fusion removes it), at the cost of
  last-few-ULP f32 reassociation and a shape-stability requirement —
  hence opt-in, not the default for the general compiler.

  ## Options

    * `:device` — `:gpu` (default) or `:cpu`. Forwarded to
      `Emily.Backend` via the `__to_backend__/1` callback.
    * `:hooks`, `:debug_options`, `:garbage_collect` — passed through
      to `Nx.Defn.Evaluator` unchanged. See its moduledoc.
    * `:max_concurrency` — accepted for `Nx.Serving` compatibility,
      but multi-partition serving is rejected because MLX kernel
      dispatch isn't thread-safe. Pass `1` (the default) to silence.
      For concurrent inference see `Emily.Stream`.
    * `:batch_keys`, `:cache` — accepted and ignored. `Nx.Serving`
      propagates `:batch_keys` to the compiler via `defn_options` for
      arity-1 serving builders (e.g. `Bumblebee.Audio.speech_to_text_whisper/5`),
      and Bumblebee passes `:cache` through for its own per-scope
      cache suffixing. Neither is used by the Evaluator walk, but
      rejecting them would break those servings.
    * `:native` — `true` compiles the traced `Nx.Defn.Expr` to a flat
      IR and replays the whole graph in a single NIF call per invocation.
      Defaults to `false`, which runs the op-by-op Evaluator walk.
    * `:native_fallback` — `:eval` (default) or `:raise`. Controls what
      happens when `native: true` but the expression contains an op or
      construct the IR can't lower yet. `:eval` routes the *whole* defn
      through `Nx.Defn.Evaluator` (each op then dispatches through
      `Emily.Backend`, with its own per-op `via_binary` fallback) and
      fires a one-shot `[:emily, :compiler, :fallback]` event, so
      installing `compiler: Emily.Compiler, native: true` globally is
      safe on any model. `:raise` re-raises the lowering error instead —
      use it in CI to prove a model lowers fully native. The per-call
      option wins over `config :emily, :native_fallback, :eval | :raise`.
    * `:native_compiled` — `true` evals the compiled program in the
      `mx::compile`'d mode instead of the plain replay. For a while-free
      forward this fuses the elementwise runs the replay leaves separate
      (the CM6 win); for a `Bumblebee.Text.generation` `defn while` it keeps
      the decode loop host-controlled but fuses each loop **body** under
      `mx::compile`, replaying the cached fused callable every token. Defaults
      to `false`; a non-boolean raises `ArgumentError`. Opt-in because the
      fusion reassociates f32 to within a few ULP — greedy token ids still
      match the evaluator, but logits are not bit-identical. Only the native
      path consults it, so it is ignored unless `native: true`.

  Any other option is silently dropped. This matches how
  `Nx.Defn.Evaluator` and EXLA handle their own option lists, and is
  the contract higher-level libraries rely on when they forward
  caller-supplied options to the JIT compiler — e.g. `Axon.build/2`,
  whose docs state that "all other options are forwarded to the
  underlying JIT compiler".

  ## Examples

  Process-global installation (typical for `Nx.Serving` / Bumblebee):

      Nx.global_default_backend(Emily.Backend)
      Nx.Defn.global_default_options(compiler: Emily.Compiler)

  Per-call:

      add_one = Nx.Defn.jit(fn x -> Nx.add(x, 1) end, compiler: Emily.Compiler)
      add_one.(Nx.tensor([1.0, 2.0]))
      # => #Nx.Tensor<f32[2] [2.0, 3.0]> on Emily.Backend
