defmodule Emily.AsyncEvalTest do
  use ExUnit.Case, async: true

  # Regression tests for the async `Emily.Native.eval/2` path.
  # `eval/2` internally dispatches to `eval_nif/2` (which returns a
  # ref) and awaits the worker's reply via `Emily.Native.Async.call/2`.
  #
  # Higher-level tests in backend_test.exs exercise eval transitively.
  # These tests pin specific properties of the async path:
  # - The caller's mailbox stays empty around an eval.
  # - A process killed mid-eval does not leak, and the worker is
  #   still usable by other callers afterward.
  # - Latency on an already-resident tensor is small (plumbing
  #   overhead, not a pessimisation versus the prior sync path).
